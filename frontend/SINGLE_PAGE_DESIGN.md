# Single-Page App Design

## This is intentionally a SINGLE-PAGE application

According to the PRD, Think Alchemist is designed as:
- **"Single-page idea transformation engine"**
- **"One-page — no dashboards, no complexity"**
- **"No multi-page dashboard"**

## Everything is on ONE page:

1. **Main Input Area**
   - Large text input box
   - "Forge" button
   - Output displays below when you forge

2. **My Creations Drawer** (slides in from right)
   - Click "My Creations" button
   - Shows your saved forges
   - Can open, re-forge, or delete

3. **Auth Modal** (pops up overlay)
   - Click "Sign In to Save"
   - Sign in/Sign up form
   - Closes after authentication

4. **Output Display** (appears on same page)
   - Shows results after forging
   - Different sections for different alchemy modes
   - "Save This Forge" button

## No separate pages or routes

Everything happens on the same screen. This is by design - it keeps the app simple, fast, and focused.
